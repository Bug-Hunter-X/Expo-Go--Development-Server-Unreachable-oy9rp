Several steps can be taken to fix this error. 

1. **Verify Network Connectivity:** Ensure your device is connected to a stable internet connection. Try connecting to a different network.
2. **Check Port Usage:** The Expo development server defaults to port 19000.  Use `netstat -a -b` (Windows) or `lsof -i :19000` (macOS/Linux) to see if another application is using this port. If it is, close that application or change the port in your Expo project's configuration.
3. **Restart Expo CLI:** Close and reopen your terminal. Then, run `expo start` again to restart the development server.
4. **Restart your device/computer:** A simple restart can resolve temporary network glitches.
5. **Check your tunnel (if using one):** If you're using a tool like ngrok, confirm it's running correctly and the URL is accessible.
6. **Check firewall/proxy:** Make sure there aren't any firewall or proxy settings that are blocking the connection to the development server. 
7. **Expo Dev Client:** If possible, install the Expo Dev Client instead of using Expo Go.  It might be more reliable and provide better diagnostics.  
8. **Clean and Rebuild:** In your project directory, delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Then rebuild your project.
