# Expo Go: Development Server Unreachable

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo Go: the development server becoming unreachable.  The `bug.js` file represents a project that might trigger this problem (though it doesn't inherently cause the error; the error is usually due to external factors). The `bugSolution.js` offers potential solutions and troubleshooting steps.

**Problem:**

When running an Expo project with Expo Go, the app displays a blank white screen or a network error message, indicating that it cannot connect to the development server.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Network Connectivity:**  Ensure your device is connected to a stable network.
* **Tunnel Issues:** If using a tunnel (like ngrok), verify it's running and configured correctly.
* **Port Conflicts:** Check that the port used by the development server isn't already in use by another application.
* **Firewall/Proxy:**  Make sure your firewall or proxy isn't blocking the connection.
* **Expo CLI Issues:** Restarting the Expo CLI or reinstalling might resolve problems.
* **Incorrect IP Address:** If using a custom IP for development, double-check for accuracy.

**Solutions (see `bugSolution.js`):**

The solution file includes steps to troubleshoot network connectivity, check port usage, and restart the Expo development server.
